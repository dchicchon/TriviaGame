## Summary
The purpose of this assignment was to create a Trivia Game that involved timed questions. If the user presses the correct button, it will add to their score count. If not, it will tell the user that they have guessed incorrectly and it will show them the correct answer.

## PseudoCode
I still need to properly implement the timers to the game because it speeds up as the user goes along the questions. Also want to dynamically add a timer to the body to show the user how much time they have left.
